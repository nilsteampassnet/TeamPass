* PostgreSQL database support
* DB2 database support
* Issue 187:	After LDAP support is configured every user (except admin) must
exist in ldap

option to disable that
* import from "Password safe" tool
* settings page. manage settings via table and do a loop in order to display
options.

be able to log all activity to a third syslog server. This would be mainly for
security and auditing.
