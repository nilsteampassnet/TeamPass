### With Docker
The Docker image provided will create a Teampass installation in its `/var/www/html/` directory, which you should mount as a volume to keep persistent. **SSL is not provided** if you use this image without a proxy in front of it. See the included [Docker Compose file](docker-compose.yml) for an example setup.

**Note:** Use `/var/www/html/sk` as your "Absolute path to saltkey" during installation.


### With Docker Compose
The included [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file is an example setup, using virtual host-based reverse proxy routing to provide SSL. If you want to use the Compose file as-is, you will need to provide an SSL certificate with a CN matching the `teampass` service's `VIRTUAL_HOST` variable. See the documentation for the [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) image for details.


**Note:** The database's hostname is `db`. You can find the database's credentials in the environment variables of the `db` service.

**Note:** Use `/var/www/html/sk` as your "Absolute path to saltkey" during installation.
