```docker-compose build```
* and run the compose app
```docker-compose up -d```
* the first time Teampass is launched, you will be prompted to configured it :
 * for the ''Absolute path to saltkey'', please use ```/teampass/sk```
 * for the database setup :
  * the host is ''db''
  * the other credentials are the ones you provided in your docker-compose file

#### Simple Docker container
* In this scenario, it is assumed you have a mysql database ready to be used. 
* First build the Teampass container :
```docker build -t teampass .```
* Then simply run the Teampass container with a volume to store the data :
```docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /srv/teampass:/teampass --name teampass teampass```
* The first launch, you will be prompted to configure Teampass :
 * for the ''Absolute path to saltkey'', please use ```/teampass/sk```
 * for the database, please provide your own database parameters
