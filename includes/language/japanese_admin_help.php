    <h3><a href='#'>Add a ROLE to a USER</a></h3>
    <div>
        You can associate a USER to as many ROLES you want. For that, just click on icon <img src='includes/images/cog_edit.png' alt='' />.<br />
        A specific dialogbox will appear in which you will have to tick or not the wanted roles.<br /><br />
        When a ROLE is added to a USER, then the USER will access to the allowed folders of that ROLE and will have no access to the forbidden ones.<br /><br />
        Now you can be more precise in the rights given to a USER by using the fields 'Allowed folders' and 'Forbidden folders'. Indeed, you can allowed or not some others folders even them specified in the ROLE.
        <div style='margin:2px Opx 0px 20px;'>
            For example:
            <p style='margin-left:20px;margin-top: 2px;'>
            - USER1 is associated to ROLE1 and ROLE2. <br />
            - ROLE1 is set to allow access to folder F1 and F2. <br />
            - F1 has 4 subfolders S1, S2, S3 and S4.<br />
            - This means that USER1 has access to F1, F2, S1, S2, S3 and S4.<br />
            - Now you can customize USER1 by forbidding the access to S4 using this page.
