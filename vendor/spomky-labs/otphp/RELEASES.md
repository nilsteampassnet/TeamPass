# Versioning and Release

This document describes the versioning and release process of OTPHP.
This document is a living document, contents will be updated according to each release.

## Releases

OTPHP releases will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/).
For this specific document, we will refer to the respective components of this triple as `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
The version number may have additional information, such as "-rc1,-rc2,-rc3" to mark release candidate builds for earlier access.
Such releases will be considered as "pre-releases".
